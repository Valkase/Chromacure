              <h3>The Issue with Refined Flour</h3>
              <p>
                White flour is refined wheat flour with the bran and germ removed, stripping away most vitamins,
                minerals, and fiber.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                It has a high glycemic index, causing rapid blood sugar spikes that increase oxidative stress and weaken
                skin immunity.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                Regular consumption can promote chronic inflammation, making autoimmune conditions like vitiligo more
                likely to spread.

              <p>
                Remember that every person with vitiligo may respond differently to foods. Keep a food diary to track
                how your skin responds to different dietary choices, and consult with your healthcare provider for
                personalized nutrition advice.
